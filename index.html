          <br>Monday Mood: 10/15/2019</br>
          <br></br>
          Real life amongst the corporate blah blah. Small updates about work life balance and the proper way to put a lighter note on life.

          All jokes aside, last week I started my first day of work. First week jitters occurred and I tired to get rid of them with a little bit of yoga. In my mind, I thought it helped, but i also think the fact that I actually got up, searched youtube for yoga, did a few downward dogs—all before 7am. It gave me something to be proud of. Mind you, I went for a run the night before and had to stop halfway through because I got hungry. Coincidentally, there was a McDonald’s right in front of me. I just realized that right now…

          I’m going to use this to summarize my week before so that Monday’s turn into something to be grateful for, rather than dreading them.

          Cool things that happened last week: I saw two of Nia’s games at Northwestern (Nia got the game winner in a must win). I went to my first happy hour with my roommate Nico. $10 for a taco, shot, and a Tecate—who in the world wants a shot at 4:30 pm? Went to my first concert of some dj that I did not know, but its was a great way to get a feel for the city. I made myself a killer avocado toast for breakfast and picked out the perfect avo.

          So, as I sat in my chair today watching an orientation video that I really didn’t want to pay attention to, but I knew I could think back of these things and smile. And these are just the little things. On top of that I have people very close to me, that support me, and that alone should be enough to give me face wrinkles from smiling so much.

          Some goals I gotta get out there! I need to get back on my workout grind. Ya boy is slacking. I have my workout gear laid out for tomorrow morning lol. No excuses. I’ll try to get at least 2 yoga sessions a week. Maybe I’ll start posting them to keep me in check. Last but not least, I will continue to keep these up, because who knows, I might read this at 40.

          Happy Birthday Sasha!</p>
